# muqsit-array-visualizer
so, hey guys This visualizers is in the works for a last few months, and I have finally created my masterpiece,there are two versions,about the development it used to work extremely good,with most of the development occuring mostly in my school laptop,howeer somethng bad happened which caused around half of the sorts to fail,I slowly added new sorts,I actually remixed the orginial project https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/230710662,then I added new sorts like nucleasr bomb sort,communism sort,true nuke and so much more,you can also pause inbetween shuffles and while sorting,I also added the option for music,however useless and I wasnt bothered to add sound,because That took a very long time,I also got a MAC to do some of the development.


check it out!
